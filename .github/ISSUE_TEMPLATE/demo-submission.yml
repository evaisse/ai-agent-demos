        ## Submit a Demo Idea

        Submit your demo idea and we'll generate implementations using multiple AI models to compare their performance!

        **What happens next?**
        1. A maintainer will review your submission
        2. Once approved (by adding the `approved` label), an automated workflow will generate the demo
        3. The results will be published to the demo viewer
