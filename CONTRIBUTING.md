# Contributing to AI Demo Generator

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide explains how to submit demo ideas and contribute to the project.

## üé® Submit a Demo Idea (Recommended for Most Contributors)

The easiest way to contribute is to submit a demo idea. Our automated workflow will handle the generation!

### How It Works

1. **Create an Issue**: [Submit a demo idea](../../issues/new?template=demo-submission.yml) using the Demo Submission template
2. **Fill the Form**:
   - **Demo Title**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Snake Game", "Todo App")
   - **Demo Prompt**: What you want to create (max 200 characters)
   - **Models**: Select which AI models should generate the demo
   - **Additional Context**: Optional details or requirements
3. **Wait for Review**: A maintainer will review your submission
4. **Automatic Generation**: Once approved, a GitHub Actions workflow will:
   - Create the demo structure
   - Generate implementations using selected models
   - Create a pull request with results
5. **Published**: After PR review and merge, your demo appears in the viewer!

### Example Submissions

**Good Examples:**
- Title: "Snake Game"
- Prompt: "a classic snake game with smooth animations and score tracking"
- Models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**More Examples:**
- "a todo app with local storage and drag-and-drop sorting"
- "an interactive calculator with memory functions and history"
- "a physics simulation with bouncing balls and realistic gravity"
- "a color picker tool with hex, RGB, and HSL conversion"

### Prompt Guidelines

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Keep prompts under 200 characters
- Be specific about functionality
- Mention visual requirements (animations, colors, etc.)
- Request single HTML file implementations
- Use CDNJS for external dependencies

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Request copyrighted content
- Ask for harmful or inappropriate content
- Require server-side functionality
- Expect multi-file projects
- Request specific brand names or trademarks
