In a single HTML file with no other file dependencies, create a Chatbot messaging screen that can use an OpenRouter API Key and select models from OpenRouter (GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models), from there store the Key localy and allow use to try the model in the chatbot. handle markdown responses from chatbot and allow to submit files. You can use external dependencies but only with CDNJS. Feel free to make pretty and shiny the way you want.
