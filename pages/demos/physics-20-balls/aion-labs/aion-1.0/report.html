The balls must follow gravity and physics, and gravity direction flips from bottom to top every 5 seconds.<br><br>Key components:<br>1. **Canvas**: We&#039;ll use HTML5 canvas for drawing.<br>2. **Balls**: Each ball will have position, velocity, radius, and mass (if needed). We&#039;ll create 20 balls starting near the center.<br>3. **Hexagon**: A regular hexagon that spins (rotates) at a constant speed.<br>4. **Gravity**: A force that acts on the balls. Initially, gravity points down (positive y). Every 5 seconds, it flips to point up (negative y) and then back, and so on.<br>5. **Physics**:<br>   - Gravity: constant acceleration in the current gravity direction.<br>   - Collisions: with the hexagon walls and possibly between balls? The problem doesn&#039;t specify ball-ball collisions, but to make it realistic, we should include them. However, to keep it simpler, we might only do wall collisions. Let me check: the problem says &quot;follow the rules of gravity and physics&quot;, so we should include both. But note: 20 balls with collisions might be heavy. We&#039;ll do simple elastic collisions with walls and between balls.<br>6. **Spinning Hexagon**: The hexagon rotates around its center. The balls are inside, so when the hexagon rotates, the walls move. The collision detection must account for the rotation.<br><br>Plan:<br><br>**HTML Structure**:<br>- A canvas element.<br>- Script tag for JavaScript.<br><br>**JavaScript**:<br>- Initialize canvas and context.<br>- Set up balls array with initial positions (near center) and random velocities.<br>- Define hexagon:<br>  - Center: center of canvas.<br>  - Radius: half the smaller dimension of canvas.<br>  - Rotation angle: starts at 0 and increments per frame.<br>- Gravity:<br>  - Variable <code>gravityY</code> that alternates between a positive value (down) and negative (up) every 5000ms.<br>  - Use <code>setInterval</code> to flip gravity every 5 seconds.<br>- Animation loop: <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.<br>  - Update rotation of hexagon.<br>  - Update ball positions:<br>      - Apply gravity: <code>vy += gravityY * timeStep</code><br>      - Update position: <code>x += vx * timeStep</code>, <code>y += vy * timeStep</code><br>  - Handle collisions:<br>      - Ball-to-ball: for each pair, if they overlap, adjust velocities (elastic collision).<br>      - Ball-to-walls: the hexagon has 6 walls. We need to check each ball against each wall segment. Since the hexagon is rotating, we can either:<br>          a) Rotate the entire coordinate system so the hexagon is axis-aligned for collision, then unrotate? This might be complex.<br>          b) Represent each wall as a line segment and use vector math to check collisions.<br><br>  How to handle hexagon wall collisions:<br>    We&#039;ll represent the hexagon by its 6 vertices (rotated by current angle). Then, for each wall (edge between two consecutive vertices), we check the distance from the ball to the line segment. If the distance is less than the ball&#039;s radius, we reflect the velocity vector.<br><br>  However, note: because the hexagon is spinning, the wall is moving. This will change the collision dynamics (like hitting a moving paddle). We need to account for the tangential velocity of the wall at the collision point.<br><br>  Alternatively, to simplify, we can make the hexagon rotation slow enough that we might ignore the moving wall effect? But the problem says &quot;spinning&quot;, so it should be noticeable.<br><br>  We can do:<br>    - The wall at a point has velocity: <code>v_wall = œâ √ó r</code> (cross product) where œâ is the angular velocity vector (perpendicular to the plane) and r is the vector from center to the collision point.<br><br>  This is getting complex. For simplicity, we might only consider the stationary hexagon? But the problem says spinning. So we must rotate.<br><br>  Another idea: Instead of having the hexagon as walls that move, we can think of the balls being in a rotating frame. Then we have to add centrifugal and Coriolis forces? That might be even more complex.<br><br>  Let me rethink: The requirement is that the hexagon spins. The balls are inside and should bounce off the walls. The walls are moving because of the spin.<br><br>  Approach without changing frame:<br>    - Each wall is a line segment that moves (rotates). For collision detection, we can check at each frame the position of the ball relative to the current wall positions.<br><br>  Steps for wall collision:<br>    For each wall (edge from p0 to p1, which are rotating around center):<br>      - Find the closest point on the segment to the ball.<br>      - Compute the distance. If &lt;= ball radius, then collision.<br>      - The normal vector at the collision: perpendicular to the wall (pointing inward).<br>      - The relative velocity of the ball with respect to the wall at the collision point:<br>          v_rel = v_ball - v_wall<br>        where v_wall at the collision point is: œâ √ó (collision_point - center) [as a vector in 2D: if œâ is angular velocity in radians per second, then v_wall = œâ * (r) but perpendicular to the radius vector?]<br><br>        Actually, in 2D: <br>          Let center = (cx, cy)<br>          Let r = (x - cx, y - cy)<br>          Then the tangential velocity of the wall at that point is: <br>            v_wall_x = -œâ * r.y<br>            v_wall_y = œâ * r.x<br><br>        But note: the entire hexagon is rigid, so every point on the wall has the same angular velocity? So for a point on the wall, we can compute v_wall as above.<br><br>      - Then, we compute the reflection of the relative velocity vector in the normal direction (elastic collision) and update the ball&#039;s velocity as:<br>          v_ball_new = v_wall + (v_rel - 2 * (v_rel ¬∑ normal) * normal)<br><br>  However, this is a non-trivial physics simulation. We have to decide on the scope.<br><br>  Considering time and complexity, we might simplify:<br><br>    Option 1: Ignore the motion of the walls for collision. Just rotate the hexagon and treat the walls as stationary for that instant. Then the collision would only reflect the ball&#039;s velocity without adjusting for wall motion. This is easier but less accurate.<br><br>    Option 2: Implement the full moving wall collision. This is more complex but more realistic.<br><br>  Since the problem says &quot;follow the rules of gravity and physics&quot;, I think we should go for Option 2.<br><br>  But note: we are also doing ball-ball collisions. We have 20 balls. This might be too heavy for JavaScript? We must optimize.<br><br>  Alternatively, we can skip ball-ball collisions and only do ball-wall? The problem doesn&#039;t specify. Let me re-read: &quot;20 balls (they follow the rules of gravity and physics)&quot; - it doesn&#039;t specify interactions. However, without ball-ball collisions, they might overlap. We&#039;ll do both for realism.<br><br>  We&#039;ll do:<br><br>    Steps in update:<br>      1. Update positions without constraints (apply gravity and move).<br>      2. Check for ball-ball collisions and resolve (using simple elastic collision with equal mass? we can assume same mass for simplicity).<br>      3. Check for ball-wall collisions and resolve (accounting for moving walls).<br><br>  But note: the order of collision resolution might matter. We might do multiple iterations for stability? Or do one pass and hope.<br><br>  Given the complexity, we&#039;ll do:<br><br>    - Ball-ball: for every pair, check if they are overlapping (distance &lt; r1+r2). Then adjust velocities by swapping the components along the line connecting centers? (standard elastic collision for equal mass).<br><br>    - Ball-wall: as described above.<br><br>  Also, we must avoid multiple collisions in one frame.<br><br>  We might use a time step small enough to avoid deep penetration.<br><br>**Implementation Steps**:<br><br>1. Setup:<br>   - Create canvas, set width and height to window size or fixed.<br>   - Define constants: number of balls, gravity magnitude, rotation speed, etc.<br><br>2. Ball class:<br>   - Properties: x, y, vx, vy, radius, color (random?).<br>   - Method: draw(ctx)<br><br>3. Hexagon:<br>   - Properties:<br>        center: {x: canvas.width/2, y: canvas.height/2}<br>        radius: min(canvas.width, canvas.height) * 0.4<br>        rotation: current angle in radians<br>        angularVelocity: constant (e.g., Math.PI / 180 * 2) // 2 degrees per frame? but we use time-based.<br><br>   - We&#039;ll update rotation: rotation += angularSpeed * deltaTime<br><br>   - Method to get vertices: <br>        var vertices = [];<br>        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {<br>            var angle = rotation + i * 2*Math.PI/6;<br>            var x = center.x + radius * Math.cos(angle);<br>            var y = center.y + radius * Math.sin(angle);<br>            vertices.push({x: x, y: y});<br>        }<br><br>4.
